## Introduction

- Recycling has played a pivotal role in preventing the degradation of natural resources in the last few decades.

--

- Recycling rate <span style="color:darkgreen"> **7% &rarr; 32%**</span> from 1960s to currently.

--

- For many years, most U.S. recyclables were exported to developing countries.

--

- China was the biggest importer of the U.S. recyclables.

--

- In 2017, China implemented its <span style="color:darkgreen"> **Green Sword (GS) Policy**</span> which banned almost all recyclable waste imports.

--

- Considerable domestic environmental costs: **air pollution** from re-processing of these materials, **landfill methane (GHG) emissions**, **land and water pollution**, as well as **ocean disposal**.

---


##GS Policy and Trade

.center[**Plastic Scrap Export Volume by Countries**]

<img src="graphs/plastic_export.png" width="800" height = "350">
.center[UN Comtrade Data]
--

- U.S. plastic scrap exports to China dropped by <span style="color:darkgreen"> **99%**</span>.

--

- U.S. plastic scrap exports to the world dropped by <span style="color:darkgreen"> **75%**</span>.

---


##Recycling Centers



- U.S. has no **economical or efficient** recycling infrastructure.

--

- Lack of granular data

--

- Zhang (2020) uses spatial analysis and finds that 

 - Before the GS policy, the PM2.5 within a **1-mile buffer** of the recycling centers is on average <span style="color:darkgreen"> **0.58 higher**</span> than the PM2.5 in a **3-9 miles buffer**.
 
--

 - After the GS policy was implemented, the PM2.5 **within a 1-mile buffer** of the recycling centers <span style="color:darkgreen">**increased 0.1**</span> on average.

--

- Recyclables went to landfills.


---





## Research Questions

- What is the effect of China's GS policy on <span style="color:darkgreen"> **Domestic Emissions**</span> from landfill facilities in the U.S.? 

--


- What are the key features of states that drive <span style="color:darkgreen">**Heterogeneous Changes**</span> in domestic emissions?

--


- What are the <span style="color:darkgreen">**Distributional Effects**</span> of the GS policy on pollution relocation for local communities at census block levels? 

--


- Does international trade and environmental policy affect local <span style="color:darkgreen">**Environmental Justice (EJ)**</span> problems?

## Roadmap
- Data
  - EPA GreenHouse Gas Report System (GHGRP)
  - CalRecycle Recycling and Disposal Reporting System (RDRS) Disposal Flow
  - U.S. Census, Trade Census, BLS, etc.

- Identification
 - Synthetic Control
 - Gravity-type fixed effects
 
- U.S. State-level Methane Emissions

- Pollution Relocation 

- Environmental Justice

---

## Preliminary Findings

- U.S. State-level Methane Emissions

  - Many states have seen <span style="color:darkgreen">**statistically significant increases**</span> in methane emission caused by the GS policy.
  
  - Heterogeneous changes in domestic methane emissions relate to <span style="color:darkgreen">**historical trade volume of recyclable wastes**</span> and <span style="color:darkgreen">**stringency of environmental regulations**</span>.

--

- Pollution Relocation 
  - Before China's GS policy, waste pollution tended to relocate to <span style="color:darkgreen">**minority communities**</span>.
  
   - After the GS policy, pollution inflows increased more for <span style="color:darkgreen">**low-income White communities**</span> as a result of an increase in waste flows across regions after the exogenous GS policy shock.
   
---
   
## Data
- [U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)](https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting)
 - Methane emissions from landfill facilities 
 - 2010 to 2020 annually 

- Why Methane Emission?
 - It can serve as a proxy for general pollution emissions.
 - It is the most "localized" greenhouse gas.
- Approximately 8,000 facilities are required to report their emissions annually.

- The industries in the system include power plants, petroleum and natural gas systems, minerals, chemicals, pulp and paper, refineries, waste, etc.

---

## Data

- [California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) Disposal Flow Data](https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/DataCentral/Materials/)

 - captures the amount of disposal transported by origin of jurisdiction and destination of facility.
 - 2002 to 2021 quarterly
 - contains 464 origin jurisdictions and 263 disposal facilities
 
--

- Other Data Sources

 - U.S. Trade Census 
 - EPA Enforcement and Compliance Historical data
 - Bureau and Labor and Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Employment and Wages at county-level
 - U.S. Census. racial composition and median income at census-block level
  
---

##Identification: Synthetic Control

- Relies on exogenous variation in methane emissions across <span style="color:darkgreen">**all other industries**</span> in the EPA GHGRP.

 - power plants, petroleum and natural gas systems, minerals, chemicals, pulp and paper, refineries, etc.
 
--

- Takes advantage of the fact that other industries which also emit GHG were not affected by China's GS policy.

- Uses other industries from all states to come up with a synthetic control group

--

- Train the model using pre-policy time **2010-2017**
 - calculate weights on state-industry pairs to minimize the prediction error.
$$\hat{Y_{1t}^{N}} = \sum_{j=2}^{J+1} w_{j} Y_{1t}$$


- Predict the counterfactual methane emissions using post-policy time **2018-2020** in the absence of GS policy 




---

## Results




<img src="graphs/California.png" width="600" height = "350">
.center[**California**]

- The difference between the actual emission and synthetic emission is the causal effect of China's GS policy on methane emissions.

$$\hat{\tau_{1t}} = Y_{1t} - \hat{Y_{1t}^{N}}$$

## Pollution Relocation

- How does <span style="color:darkgreen">**International Trade policy**</span> affect <span style="color:darkgreen">**pollution relocation**</span>? 

--

- Does pollution relocate? 
 - **Cap and Trade** Clean Air Act requiring new or expanding plants to pay incumbents in the same or neighboring counties to reduce their pollution emissions (Shapiro and Walker (2021)).
 
--
 
 - **US air pollution offset markets**  Clean Air Act has allowed for trading of permanent pollution emissions rights between firms within a metropolitan area (Shapiro and Walker (2020)).
 
--

 - **Externality-export strategy for air pollution**  Clean Air Act (Morehouse and Rubin (2022))

--
 
 - <span style="color:darkgreen">**Waste flow**</span> Not In my Backyard (NIMBY) regulation limits interstate waste flows (Ho (2020)).

## Gravity Model 



$$log(Y_{ijt}) = \alpha + \beta_{1} log(Dist_{ij}) + \beta_{2} R_{i} + \beta_{3} R_{j} + \beta_{4} log(X_{it}) + \beta_{5} log(X_{jt}) +$$
$$\epsilon_{o} + \theta_{d} + \mu_{od} + \eta_{t} + \lambda_{odt}$$






- $i$ is the origin jurisdiction of California 

- $j$ is the area that is a 3km buffer within the destination facility

--

- $R_{it}$ and $R_{jt}$ <span style="color:darkgreen">**are racial compositions of origin i and destination j.**</span>

- $Y_{ijt}$ <span style="color:darkgreen">**is the tons of the disposal transported from $i$ to  $j$ in time t.**</span>

--

- $Dist_{ij}$ is the distance between origin i and destination j.

- $X_{it}$ and $X_{jt}$ are socioeconomic factors, regulation of environmental stringency, and economies of scale of waste industry of origin and destination i and j. 

--

- Fixed-effects: $\epsilon_{o}$, $\theta_{d}$, $\mu_{od}$, $\eta_{t}$, $\lambda_{odt}$

## Conclusion

-I use empirical methods and provide causal evidence that state-level <span style="color:darkgreen">**methane emissions**</span> from the U.S.  waste industry <span style="color:darkgreen">**increased**</span> after the GS policy.



--

-I find that before China's GS policy, <span style="color:darkgreen">**minority communities**</span> tended to <span style="color:darkgreen">**receive increasing amounts of waste pollution from elsewhere**</span>. 



--

-However, after China's GS policy, <span style="color:darkgreen">**low income white communities**</span> experienced <span style="color:darkgreen">**greater increases in waste pollution inflows**</span> than minority communities as a result of the exogenous trade policy shock. 



---

## Future Work Plan

- Control for <span style="color:darkgreen">**California's wild fires**</span>, which could be a noise in my estimates for GS policy.

--

- In addition to racial composition of the community, examine the relationship between <span style="color:darkgreen">**industry vertical integration (economies of scale)**</span> of the community and pollution relocation.

--

- Empirically evaluate if there is <span style="color:darkgreen">**environmental gentrification**</span> happening in the past four decades because of the pollution (waste) relocation.
