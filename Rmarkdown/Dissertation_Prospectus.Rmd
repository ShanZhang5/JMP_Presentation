## Background


In 2015, the U.S. exported **4.5 billion** pounds of scrap plastic for "recycling", over half of which was sold to China.

--
<br/>
<br/>
- In 2017, **China’s Green Sword (GS) Policy** bans the importation of certain types of solid waste and tightens contamination limits for some recyclable materials.
<br/>
<br/>
 - Policy's effect on <span style="color:darkgreen">negative-externality export</span>
<br/>
<br/>
 - **Internationally**: pollution haven transition; import control; environmental justice
<br/>
<br/>
 - **Domestically**: landfills and emissions; pollution relocation; environmental discrimination

## Introduction

- Recycling rate <span style="color:darkgreen"> **7% &rarr; 32%**</span> from 1960s to present

--

- For many years, most U.S. recyclables were exported to developing countries

--

- China was the biggest importer of U.S. recyclables

--

- In 2017, China implemented its <span style="color:darkgreen"> **Green Sword (GS) Policy**</span> banning almost all recyclable waste imports

--

- Considerable domestic environmental costs
 - **air pollution** from re-processing of these materials
 - **landfill methane (GHG) emissions**
 - **land and water pollution**
 - **ocean disposal**

--

- U.S. has no **economical or efficient** recycling infrastructure
 - Recyclables went to landfills.

--

- U.S. plastic scrap exports to the ROW <span style="color:darkgreen"> **increased, then  decreased** </span> after China's GS policy
---

## Research Questions

<br/>
<br/>

- For the **U.S.**

 - What has been the effect of China's GS policy on <span style="color:darkgreen"> **Domestic Emissions**</span> from landfill facilities? 

<br/>
<br/>

--


- For the state of **California**

 - What are the <span style="color:darkgreen">**Distributional Effects**</span> of the GS policy on pollution relocation for local communities at census block levels? 
 - What are <span style="color:darkgreen">**Environmental Justice (EJ)**</span> implications?

.pull-right[ 
- Why use <span style="color:darkgreen"> **methane**</span> emissions?

 - They are a **proxy** for general pollution emissions
 
 - Methane is far more potent at trapping the sun’s heat than carbon emissions
 
 - Satellite data is available only from 2020
 
 - Need consistently measured emissions data from 2010 to 2020
]
---
   
## Data
- [U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)](https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting)

 - Methane emissions from landfill facilities 
 - 2010 to 2020 annually 

--

- Approximately 8,000 facilities required to report emissions annually

- High compliance rates

--

- Covered industries include power plants, petroleum and natural gas systems, minerals, chemicals, pulp and paper, refineries, waste, etc.

--


- Data generation process:
 - Facilities in waste industry report the **amount of wastes accepted** annually 
 - Methane Emission is calculated through a complicated model embedded in U.S. EPA

---

## Data

- [California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) Disposal Flow Data](https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/DataCentral/Materials/)

 - Captures the amount of disposal transported by origin jurisdiction and destination facility
 - 2002 to 2021 quarterly
 - Contains 464 origin jurisdictions and 263 disposal facilities
 
--

- Other Data Sources

 - U.S. Trade Census 
 - EPA Enforcement and Compliance Historical data
 - Bureau and Labor and Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Employment and Wages at county level
 - U.S. Census racial mix, median income at census-block level
  
---

##Identification: Synthetic Control Method

- Rely on exogenous variation in methane emissions across <span style="color:darkgreen">**all other industries**</span> in the EPA GHGRP

 - Power plants, petroleum and natural gas systems, minerals, chemicals, pulp and paper, refineries, etc. (**not** waste)
 
--

- Take advantage of the fact that other industries which also emit GHG were not affected by China's GS policy

--

- Use other industries(all states) as donor pool for synthetic control group

--

- Train the model using pre-policy time **2010-2017**
 - calculate state-industry pair weights to minimize prediction error
$$\hat{Y_{1t}^{N}} = \sum_{j=2}^{J+1} w_{j} Y_{1t}$$


- Predict counterfactual methane emissions in the absence of GS policy using post-policy period (**2018-2020**) 




---

## Results

<img src="graphs/California_synthetic_control.png" width="800" height = "350">
.center[Fig 3.3 California Waste Industry Emission Synthetic Control]

- The difference between actual emissions and synthetic emissions is the causal effect of China's GS policy on U.S. landfill methane emissions

$$\hat{\tau_{1t}} = Y_{1t} - \hat{Y_{1t}^{N}}$$

## Pollution Relocation

- How does <span style="color:darkgreen">**International Trade policy**</span> affect <span style="color:darkgreen">**pollution relocation**</span>? 

--

- Does pollution relocate? 
 - **Cap and Trade** - Clean Air Act requires new or expanding plants to pay incumbents in the same or neighboring counties to reduce their pollution emissions (Shapiro and Walker (2021)).
 
--
 
 - **US air pollution offset markets** - Clean Air Act allows for trading of permanent pollution emissions rights between firms within a metropolitan area (Shapiro and Walker (2020)).
 
--

 - **Externality-export strategy for air pollution** - Clean Air Act (Morehouse and Rubin (2022))

--
 
 - <span style="color:darkgreen">**Waste flow**</span> - Not In my Backyard (NIMBY) regulations limit interstate waste flows (Ho (2020)).

   Waste tend to relocate to <span style="color:darkgreen">**minority communities**</span>

  - After China's GS policy
  
    Inflows increased more for <span style="color:darkgreen">**lower income white communities**</span>

## Introduction

- China's GS Policy diverted recyclable waste exports of developed countries from China to other developing and underdeveloped countries

--

- Waste relocated internationally affects litter on the coast/beach

--

- Hypothesis 
 - The policy does not affect the developed (exporting) countries much because of more proper disposal, more conscious about environment, etc.
 - The policy affects the developing countries (importing) countries more because of inappropriate disposal

## Next Steps
- **Two-way Fixed Effects DID Model**
$$y_{it} = \alpha+ \beta_{1} D_{t}+ \beta_{2} T_{i} + \beta_{3}  D_{t}*T_{i} + \gamma X_{it}  + \theta Z_{i}+\nu T_{t} + \epsilon_{it}$$
 - $y_{it}$ items collected per person
 - $D_{t}$ policy dummy variable
 - $T_{i}$ treated countries 
 
 
<br/>
<br/>

- Expand the exporting and importing countries

- Use geographic coordinates for spatial analysis?

## Introduction

- <span style="color:darkgreen">**Pandemic has highlighted issue of individuals' willingness to bear costs to protect health of others in their community**</span>
<br/>
<br/>
 - Lockdown unemployment, social distancing, masks
<br/>
<br/>
 - COVID-19 causes **non-fatal illness** as well as deaths
<br/>
<br/>
 - Standard VSL may not be appropriate
<br/>
<br/>
 - ...Revisit 2003 public health choice-experiment survey

- Predicted WTP amounts differ:
 - Over time by cases, deaths, employment, employment change
 - Spatially by county sociodemog. characteristics

## Conclusion

- Exploit existing 2003-era online choice-experiment data
 - Re-estimate WTP function (only county-level heterogeneity)
 - Transfer fitted model to 2020--2021 pandemic context
 - WTP to avoid that many generic illnesses, deaths?

- Estimate aggregate national WTP  (Mar 2020--Dec 2021)
 - Cumulative total **~ $3 trillion** (lower bound)
 - Does not include WTP to avoid fear of contagion
 - Does not include WTP to avoid restrictions, masks
