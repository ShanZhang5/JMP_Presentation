## Introduction

- Recycling rate <span style="color:darkgreen"> **7% &rarr; 32%**</span> from 1960s to present

--

- For many years, most U.S. recyclables exported to developing countries

--

- China was the biggest importer of U.S. recyclables

--

- In 2017, China implemented its <span style="color:darkgreen"> **Green Sword (GS) Policy**</span> banning almost all recyclable waste imports

--

- Considerable domestic environmental costs
 - **air pollution** from re-processing of these materials
 - **landfill methane (GHG) emissions**
 - **land and water pollution**
 - **ocean disposal**

--

- U.S. has no **economical or efficient** recycling infrastructure
 - Recyclables went to landfills.

## Research Questions

<br/>
<br/>

 - What has been the effect of China's GS policy on <span style="color:darkgreen"> **Domestic Emissions**</span> from landfill facilities? 

--

 - What are the key features of states that drive <span style="color:darkgreen">**Heterogeneous Changes**</span> in domestic emissions?

--


- For the state of **California**

 - What are the <span style="color:darkgreen">**Distributional Effects**</span> of the GS policy on pollution relocation for local communities at census-block levels? 

--

 - What are <span style="color:darkgreen">**Environmental Justice (EJ)**</span> implications? What's the mechanism?

## Data
- [U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)](https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting)

 - Methane emissions from landfill facilities 
 - 2010 to 2020 annually 

--

- Approximately 8,000 facilities required to report emissions annually

- High compliance rates

--

- Covered industries include power plants, petroleum and natural gas systems, minerals, chemicals, pulp and paper, refineries, waste, etc.

--


- Data generation process:
 - Facilities in waste industry report annual **amount of wastes accepted**  
 - Methane emissions are calculated using a complicated model embedded in U.S. EPA

---

## Data

- [California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) Disposal Flow Data](https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/DataCentral/Materials/)

 - Captures the amount of disposal transported by origin jurisdiction and destination facility
 - 2002 to 2021 quarterly
 - Contains 464 origin jurisdictions and 263 disposal facilities
 
--

- Other Data Sources

 - U.S. Trade Census 
 - EPA Enforcement and Compliance Historical data
 - Bureau and Labor and Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Employment and Wages at county level
 - U.S. Census racial mix, median income at census-block level
 - Statewide Database (SWDB) election data at precinct level
  
---

##Identification: Synthetic Control Method

- Rely on exogenous variation in methane emissions across <span style="color:darkgreen">**all other industries**</span> in the EPA GHGRP

 - Power plants, petroleum and natural gas systems, minerals, chemicals, pulp and paper, refineries, etc. (**not** waste)
 
--

- Take advantage of the fact that other industries which also emit GHGs were not affected by China's GS policy

--

- Use other industries (all states) as donor pool for synthetic control group

--

- Train the model using the pre-policy period **2010-2017**
 - Calculate state-industry pair weights to minimize prediction error
$$\hat{Y_{1t}^{N}} = \sum_{j=2}^{J+1} w_{j} Y_{1t}$$


- Predict counterfactual methane emissions in the absence of GS policy using post-policy period (**2018-2020**) 




---

## Results




<img src="graphs/California_synthetic_control.png" width="800" height = "350">
.center[**California**]

- The difference between actual emissions and synthetic emissions is the causal effect of China's GS policy on U.S. landfill methane emissions

$$\hat{\tau_{1t}} = Y_{1t} - \hat{Y_{1t}^{N}}$$

## Preliminary Results

**California Pollution Relocation** 

- Before China's GS policy
  
  - Waste tends to flow to <span style="color:darkgreen">**minority communities**</span>

--

- After China's GS policy
  
 - Inflows increased more for <span style="color:darkgreen">** lower-income white communities**</span>
 
--

- Counterintuitive?
    
---


## Mechanism -- Political Costs

- Racial composition of the destination community is highly correlated with voting patterns

.center[<img src="graphs/political_race.png" width="400" height = "250">]

.center[**Correlation between White percentage by census blocks and Republican share by voting precincts**]

--

- Higher Republican votes, higher percentage of White population

--

- Do disposal inflows to Republican communities increase more due to political costs?
<br/>

## Pollution Relocation and Political Costs: Simple model
<font size="3"> 
- Pollution relocation depends on **transportation costs** and **political costs**
$$Y_{ij} = \frac{\overline Y_{i}}{C_{ij}(d_{ij}\cdot f_{ij})\cdot P_{ij}(V{jc})}$$
 - $Y_{ij}$ is pollution relocated from jurisdiction $i$ to facility $j$
 - $\overline Y_{i}$ is the waste pollution generated by jurisdiction $i$
 - $C_{ij}(d_{ij}\cdot f_{ij})$ is a transportation cost function w.r.t distance (overseas/domestic) and fuel price per mile
 - $P_{ij}(V{jc})$ is a political cost function w.r.t. votes in district where facility $j$ located

--

- Political costs depend on the distance between precinct(destination) votes and state-incumbent votes
$$V{jc} = v_{j} - \overline v_{c}$$
 - $v_{j}$ is the votes of the district
 - $v_{c}$ is California's incumbent votes
 - $V_{jc}$ is the political cost of the destination community

--


.pull-left[- Before China's policy shock
 - $C_{ij}(d_{ij}\cdot f_{ij})$ << $P_{ij}(V{jc})$
 - Political costs prevail
 ]

 
.pull-right[- After China's policy shock
 - $C_{ij}(d_{ij}))$ >> $P_{ij}(V{jc})$
 - Marginal political costs deminished
 ]

## Intuition


.pull-center[
<img src="graphs/mechanism_1.png" width="800" height = "400">
]


- China's GS policy shock shifts the curve flatter (less elastic)
- Excessive pollution relocation shifted from Republican communities to Democratic communities

## Conclusion Preliminary Findings

- **U.S. State-level Methane Emissions**

  - Many states: <span style="color:darkgreen">statistically significant increases</span> in methane emissions
  
  - Relate to <span style="color:darkgreen">historical trade volume</span>, <span style="color:darkgreen">stringency of envir. regulations</span>

--

- **California Pollution Relocation** 

  - Before China's GS policy
  
   Waste tend to relocate to <span style="color:darkgreen">minority communities</span>
   
  - After China's GS policy
  
    Inflows increased more for <span style="color:darkgreen">remote lower income white communities</span>
    
   - Potential mechanism 
   
   Waste tended to relocate to places that have <span style="color:darkgreen">**lower political costs**</span>. After GS policy shock, pollution relocated more to higher political costs places
