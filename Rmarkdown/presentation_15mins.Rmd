## Introduction

- Recycling has played a pivotal role in preventing the degradation of natural resources in the last few decades.

--

- Recycling rate <span style="color:darkgreen"> **7% &rarr; 32%**</span> from 1960s to currently.

--

- For many years, most U.S. recyclables were exported to developing countries.

--

- China joined the WTO in 2001.

--

- In 2017, China implemented its <span style="color:darkgreen"> **Green Sword (GS) Policy**</span> which banned almost all recyclable waste imports.

--

- Considerable domestic environmental costs: **air pollution** from re-processing of these materials, **landfill methane (GHG) emissions**, **land and water pollution**, as well as **ocean disposal**.

---

## Research Questions

- What is the effect of China's GS policy on <span style="color:darkgreen"> **State-level Methane Emissions**</span> from landfill facilities? 

--


- What are the key features of states that drive <span style="color:darkgreen">**Heterogeneous Changes**</span> in methane emissions?

--


- What are the <span style="color:darkgreen">**Distributional Effects**</span> of the GS policy on pollution relocation for local communities (at both county and census block levels) in the state of California? 

--


- Does international trade and environmental policy affect local <span style="color:darkgreen">**Environmental Justice (EJ)**</span> problems?

## Data
- [U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)](https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting)
 - Methane emissions from landfill facilities 
 - 2010 to 2020 annually 

- Why Methane Emission?
 - It is the most "localized" greenhouse gas.
 - It can serve as a proxy for other pollution.
- Approximately 8,000 facilities are required to report their emissions annually.

- The industries in the system include power plants, petroleum and natural gas systems, minerals, chemicals, pulp and paper, refineries, waste, etc.

---

## Data

- [California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) Disposal Flow Data](https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/DataCentral/Materials/)

 - captures the amount of disposal transported by origin jurisdiction and destination facility.
 - 2002 to 2021 quarterly
 - contains 464 origin jurisdictions and 263 disposal facilities
 
--

- Control variables

 - U.S. Trade Census 
 - EPA Enforcement and Compliance Historical data
 - Bureau and Labor and Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Employment and Wages at county-level
 - U.S. Census. racial composition and median income at census-block level

##Identification: Synthetic Control

.pull-left[
- Relies on exogenous variation in methane emissions across all other industries in the EPA GHGRP.
 - power plants, petroleum and natural gas systems, minerals, chemicals, pulp and paper, refineries, etc.

- Takes advantage of the fact that other industries which also emit GHG were not affected by China's GS policy.

- Uses other industries from all states to come up with a synthetic control group

## Results


.pull-left[
- Train the model using pre-policy time **2010-2017**
 - calculate weights on state-industry pairs to minimize the prediction error.

- Predict the model using post-policy time **2018-2020**
 - use calculated weights to predict the counterfactual methane emissions in the absence of GS policy

]

- The difference between the actual emission and synthetic emission is the causal effect of China's GS policy on methane emissions.


---
## Results 

- After the GS policy took effect, states like California, Washington, New York, Virginia and Texas have seen significant increases in methane emissions in their waste industry by 0.5%, 0.51%, 0.6%, 0.55%, and 0.31% respectively.

- Other states like Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana, Ohio and Oregon have also seen significant increases in methane emissions, by 0.22%, 0.19%, 0.5%, 0.3%, 0.15%, 0.2% and 0.21% respectively.

## Pollution Relocation

- Does pollution relocate? 
 - **Cap and Trade** Clean Air Act requiring new or expanding plants to pay incumbents in the same or neighboring counties to reduce their pollution emissions (Shapiro and Walker (2021)).
 
--
 
 - **US air pollution offset markets**  Clean Air Act has allowed for trading of permanent pollution emissions rights between firms within a metropolitan area (Shapiro and Walker (2020)).
 
--

 - **Externality-export strategy for air pollution**  Clean Air Act (Morehouse and Rubin (2022))

--
 
 - <span style="color:darkgreen">**Waste flow**</span> Not In my Backyard (NIMBY) regulation limits interstate waste flows (Ho (2020)).

- How does <span style="color:darkgreen">**International Trade policy**</span> affect <span style="color:darkgreen">**pollution relocation**</span>?

## Gravity Model 



$$log(Y_{ijt}) = \alpha + \beta_{1} log(Dist_{ij}) + \beta_{2} log(X_{it}) + \beta_{3} log(X_{jt}) +$$
$$\epsilon_{i
} + \theta_{j} + \mu_{ij} + \eta_{t} + \lambda_{ijt}$$






- $i$ is origin jurisdiction of California. 

- $j$ is the area that is a 3km buffer within the destination facility.

- $Y_{ijt}$ is the tons of the disposal transported from $i$ to  $j$ in quarter t.


- $Dist_{ij}$ is the distance between origin i and destination j.


- $X_{it}$ and $X_{jt}$ are racial composition, socioeconomic factors, regulation of environmental stringency, and economies of scale of waste industry of origin and destination i and j. 


- Fixed-effects: $\epsilon_{i}$, $\theta_{j}$, $\mu_{ij}$, $\eta_{t}$, $\lambda_{ijt}$

## Conclusion Preliminary Findings

- U.S. State-level Methane Emissions

  - Many states have seen <span style="color:darkgreen">**statistically significant increases**</span> in methane emission caused by the GS policy.
  
  - Heterogeneous changes in domestic methane emissions relate to <span style="color:darkgreen">**historical trade volume of recyclable wastes**</span> and <span style="color:darkgreen">**stringency of environmental regulations**</span>.

--

- Pollution Relocation 
  - Before China's GS policy, waste pollution tend to relocate to <span style="color:darkgreen">**minority communities**</span>.
  
   - After the GS policy, pollution inflows increased more for <span style="color:darkgreen">**low-income white communities**</span> as a result of an increase in waste flows across regions after the exogenous GS policy shock.
   

---

## Future Work Plan

- Control for <span style="color:darkgreen">**California's wild fires**</span>, which could be a noise in my estimates for GS policy. 

- Examine the relationship between <span style="color:darkgreen">** vertical integration of waste industry (economies of scale)**</span> of the community and pollution relocation.

- Empirically evaluate if there was <span style="color:darkgreen">**environmental gentrification**</span> happening in the past four decades because of the pollution (waste) relocation.
