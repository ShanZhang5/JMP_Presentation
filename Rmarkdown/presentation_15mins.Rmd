## Introduction

- Recycling rate <span style="color:darkgreen"> **7% &rarr; 32%**</span> from 1960s to present

--

- For many years, most U.S. recyclables were exported to developing countries

--

- China was the biggest importer of U.S. recyclables

--

- In 2017, China implemented its <span style="color:darkgreen"> **Green Sword (GS) Policy**</span> banning almost all recyclable waste imports

--

- Considerable domestic environmental costs
 - **air pollution** from re-processing of these materials
 - **landfill methane (GHG) emissions**
 - **land and water pollution**
 - **ocean disposal**

--

- U.S. has no **economical or efficient** recycling infrastructure
 - Recyclables went to landfills.

## Research Questions

<br/>
<br/>

- For the **U.S.**

 - What has been the effect of China's GS policy on <span style="color:darkgreen"> **Domestic Emissions**</span> from landfill facilities? 

<br/>
<br/>

--


- For the state of **California**

 - What are the <span style="color:darkgreen">**Distributional Effects**</span> of the GS policy on pollution relocation for local communities at census block levels? 
 - What are <span style="color:darkgreen">**Environmental Justice (EJ)**</span> implications?

## Environmental Outcome Measurement

.pull-right[ 
- Why use <span style="color:darkgreen"> **methane**</span> emissions?

 - They are a **proxy** for general pollution emissions
 
 - Methane is far more potent at trapping the sun’s heat than carbon emissions
 
 - Satellite data is available only from 2020
 
 - Need consistently measured emissions data from 2010 to 2020
]
---
   
## Data
- [U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)](https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting)

 - Methane emissions from landfill facilities 
 - 2010 to 2020 annually 

--

- Approximately 8,000 facilities required to report emissions annually

- High compliance rates

--

- Covered industries include power plants, petroleum and natural gas systems, minerals, chemicals, pulp and paper, refineries, waste, etc.

--


- Data generation process:
 - Facilities in waste industry report the **amount of wastes accepted** annually 
 - Methane Emission is calculated through a complicated model embedded in U.S. EPA

---

## Data

- [California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) Disposal Flow Data](https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/DataCentral/Materials/)

 - Captures the amount of disposal transported by origin jurisdiction and destination facility
 - 2002 to 2021 quarterly
 - Contains 464 origin jurisdictions and 263 disposal facilities
 
--

- Other Data Sources

 - U.S. Trade Census 
 - EPA Enforcement and Compliance Historical data
 - Bureau and Labor and Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Employment and Wages at county level
 - U.S. Census racial mix, median income at census-block level
  
---

##Identification: Synthetic Control Method

- Rely on exogenous variation in methane emissions across <span style="color:darkgreen">**all other industries**</span> in the EPA GHGRP

 - Power plants, petroleum and natural gas systems, minerals, chemicals, pulp and paper, refineries, etc. (**not** waste)
 
--

- Take advantage of the fact that other industries which also emit GHG were not affected by China's GS policy

--

- Use other industries(all states) as donor pool for synthetic control group

--

- Train the model using pre-policy time **2010-2017**
 - calculate state-industry pair weights to minimize prediction error
$$\hat{Y_{1t}^{N}} = \sum_{j=2}^{J+1} w_{j} Y_{1t}$$


- Predict counterfactual methane emissions in the absence of GS policy using post-policy period (**2018-2020**) 




---

## Results




<img src="graphs/California.png" width="800" height = "350">
.center[**California**]

- The difference between actual emissions and synthetic emissions is the causal effect of China's GS policy on U.S. landfill methane emissions

$$\hat{\tau_{1t}} = Y_{1t} - \hat{Y_{1t}^{N}}$$

## Pollution Relocation

- How does <span style="color:darkgreen">**International Trade policy**</span> affect <span style="color:darkgreen">**pollution relocation**</span>? 

--

- Does pollution relocate? 
 - **Cap and Trade** - Clean Air Act requires new or expanding plants to pay incumbents in the same or neighboring counties to reduce their pollution emissions (Shapiro and Walker (2021)).
 
--
 
 - **US air pollution offset markets** - Clean Air Act allows for trading of permanent pollution emissions rights between firms within a metropolitan area (Shapiro and Walker (2020)).
 
--

 - **Externality-export strategy for air pollution** - Clean Air Act (Morehouse and Rubin (2022))

--
 
 - <span style="color:darkgreen">**Waste flow**</span> - Not In my Backyard (NIMBY) regulations limit interstate waste flows (Ho (2020)).

## Conclusion Preliminary Findings

- **U.S. State-level Methane Emissions**

  - Many states show <span style="color:darkgreen">statistically significant increases</span> in methane emission
  
  - Relate to <span style="color:darkgreen">historical trade volume</span>, <span style="color:darkgreen">stringency of envir. regulations</span>

--

- **California Pollution Relocation** 

  - Before China's GS policy
  
   Waste tend to relocate to <span style="color:darkgreen">minority communities</span>
   
  - After China's GS policy
  
    Inflows increased more for <span style="color:darkgreen">remote low-income white communities</span>
