## Introduction

- Recycling rate <span style="color:darkgreen"> **7% &rarr; 32%**</span> from 1960s to present.

--

- For many years, most U.S. recyclables were exported to developing countries.

--

- China was the biggest importer of the U.S. recyclables.

--

- In 2017, China implemented its <span style="color:darkgreen"> **Green Sword (GS) Policy**</span> which banned almost all recyclable waste imports.

--

- Considerable domestic environmental costs: **air pollution** from re-processing of these materials, **landfill methane (GHG) emissions**, **land and water pollution**, as well as **ocean disposal**.

--

- U.S. has no **economical or efficient** recycling infrastructure.

--

- Recyclables went to landfills.

- U.S. plastic scrap exports to China dropped by <span style="color:darkgreen"> **99%**</span>.

--

- U.S. plastic scrap exports to the world dropped by <span style="color:darkgreen"> **75%**</span>.

## Research Questions

<br/>
<br/>

- In the **U.S.**

 - What is the effect of China's GS policy on <span style="color:darkgreen"> **Domestic Emissions**</span> from landfill facilities in the U.S.? 

<br/>
<br/>

--


- In the state of **California**

## Environmental Outcome Measurement

.pull-right[ 
- Why Methane Emission?

 - It can serve as a **proxy** for general pollution emissions.
 
 - Methane is far more potent at trapping the sun’s heat than carbon emissions.
 
 - Satellite data is available only from 2020.
 
 - Need a consistent measured emission data from 2010 to 2020
]
---
   
## Data
- [U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)](https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting)

 - Methane emissions from landfill facilities 
 - 2010 to 2020 annually 

--

- Approximately 8,000 facilities are required to report their emissions annually.

--

- The industries in the system include power plants, petroleum and natural gas systems, minerals, chemicals, pulp and paper, refineries, waste, etc.

--


- Data generation process:
 - Facilities in waste industry report the **amount of wastes accepted** annually. 
 - Methane Emission is calculated through a complicated model embedded in U.S. EPA.

---

## Data

- [California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) Disposal Flow Data](https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/DataCentral/Materials/)

 - Captures the amount of disposal transported by origin jurisdiction and destination facility.
 - 2002 to 2021 quarterly
 - Contains 464 origin jurisdictions and 263 disposal facilities
 
--

- Other Data Sources

 - U.S. Trade Census 
 - EPA Enforcement and Compliance Historical data
 - Bureau and Labor and Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Employment and Wages at county-level
 - U.S. Census. racial composition and median income at census-block level
  
---

##Identification: Synthetic Control

- Relies on exogenous variation in methane emissions across <span style="color:darkgreen">**all other industries**</span> in the EPA GHGRP.

 - power plants, petroleum and natural gas systems, minerals, chemicals, pulp and paper, refineries, etc.
 
--

- Takes advantage of the fact that other industries which also emit GHG were not affected by China's GS policy.

- Uses other industries from all states to come up with a synthetic control group

--

- Train the model using pre-policy time **2010-2017**
 - calculate weights on state-industry pairs to minimize the prediction error.
$$\hat{Y_{1t}^{N}} = \sum_{j=2}^{J+1} w_{j} Y_{1t}$$


- Predict the counterfactual methane emissions using post-policy time **2018-2020** in the absence of GS policy 




---

## Results




<img src="graphs/California.png" width="600" height = "350">
.center[**California**]

- The difference between the actual emission and synthetic emission is the causal effect of China's GS policy on methane emissions.

$$\hat{\tau_{1t}} = Y_{1t} - \hat{Y_{1t}^{N}}$$

## Pollution Relocation

- How does <span style="color:darkgreen">**International Trade policy**</span> affect <span style="color:darkgreen">**pollution relocation**</span>? 

--

- Does pollution relocate? 
 - **Cap and Trade** Clean Air Act requiring new or expanding plants to pay incumbents in the same or neighboring counties to reduce their pollution emissions (Shapiro and Walker (2021)).
 
--
 
 - **US air pollution offset markets**  Clean Air Act has allowed for trading of permanent pollution emissions rights between firms within a metropolitan area (Shapiro and Walker (2020)).
 
--

 - **Externality-export strategy for air pollution**  Clean Air Act (Morehouse and Rubin (2022))

--
 
 - <span style="color:darkgreen">**Waste flow**</span> Not In my Backyard (NIMBY) regulation limits interstate waste flows (Ho (2020)).

## Conclusion Preliminary Findings

- **U.S. State-level Methane Emissions**

  - Many states have seen <span style="color:darkgreen">statistically significant increases</span> in methane emission.
  
  - Relate to <span style="color:darkgreen">historical trade volume</span> and <span style="color:darkgreen">stringency of environmental regulations</span>.

--

- **California Pollution Relocation** 

  - Before China's GS policy
  
   Waste pollution tend to relocate to <span style="color:darkgreen">minority communities</span>.
   
  - After China's GS policy
  
   Pollution inflows increased more for <span style="color:darkgreen">lower-income white communities</span>.
