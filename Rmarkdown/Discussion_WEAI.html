# Bikesharing, Metro Stations, and House Prices: Evidence from Washington’s Capital Bikeshare System

## Research Question:

**What's the overall effect of bike-sharing systems on residential property prices and metro station house price gradient?**
 - Is proximity to metro stations associated with higher house prices?
 - How does the introduction of bike sharing stations near a residential property affect house prices differently at different distances to the closest metro station?
 - Do bikeshare systems affect metro station house price gradient, and in which direction?
 
--
 
&lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;What's the difference between the second and the third question? Define more clearly what's "metro station house price gradient"?&lt;/span&gt; 


---

## Research Question:

It is an interesting question to think about the effect of the interactions of bike-sharing systems and metro stations on property prices

--

It makes me naturally wonder about the mechanisms: through what channels do bike-sharing systems affect the housing prices around metro stations?
 - More options to commute?
 - Easier to travel to the metro station compared to walking?
 - Using bikes as exercise amenities?
 
---

## Data

 - Zillow’s Transaction and Assessment Database (ZTRAX). 
  - Single-family houses, townhouses, and condominiums 
  - The analysis only includes single-family houses. It could be very interesting to have different types of houses/homes in the analysis to cover residents' heterogeneous preferences
  
--

 - Bike Sharing Stations and Metro Stations Data
  - Most bike sharing stations are close to metro stations
  - bike-sharing docks are not distributed randomly
  - locations of metro stations and bike sharing docks are highly correlated

  
---


## Empirical Strategy

- Identification threat:

The impact of docked bike sharing systems on house prices and metro station house price gradient is endogeneous to bikesharing station locations and opening dates.

--

- DID with Two-Way Fixed Effects

 - locations and opening dates of bike sharing stations are random, conditioned on the controls variables: neighborhood characteristics, property distance to park, distance to retail location, property distance to metro station, as well as time and census-tract fixed effects.
 
--
 
 - Be more explicit about how these control variables and fixed effects solve for different endogeneity scenarios.
 
--
 
 - Are control variables and fixed effects enough to solve the endogeneity problem? &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;Who&lt;/span&gt;  makes the decision of siting the bikesharing docks? &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;What's the decision process&lt;/span&gt;  of siting the bikesharing dock? &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;What are the factors that affect the bikesharing dock siting&lt;/span&gt; ? Is there any internal connection between metro station and bikesharing companies?

## Empirical Strategy

- &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt; TWFE Diff-in-diff: Callaway and Sant’Anna (2021), Sun and Abraham (2021), Borusyak et al. (2021)&lt;/span&gt;
 - Use to check robustness?

--
 
- The treatment event is defined as the opening of a bike share station within 0.3 miles of a property
 - Can you do a couple other distances for robustness check? See treatment to be 0.4,.0.5, 0.2 miles within a property? 
 - &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;Maybe spatial lag models? Make distance bands?&lt;/span&gt;
 
--
 
- Event study to check parallel trends assumption
 - Great

 
---

## Results

**Single-family house prices fall as the distance to the closest metro station increases.**

 - Very intuitive

--

**For single-family houses within 0.5 miles of the closest metro station, the opening of bike sharing stations within 0.3 miles increases property price by a statistically significant 5% on average.**

 - &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;Big increase! Mechanism?&lt;/span&gt;

--

 - It would be interesting to look at how townhouses and condominiums are affected; how about rental market?

--

 - It would also be interesting to see the heterogeneous effects of bike sharing stations on housing price by neighborhood income-levels and racial compositions.

--
 
**The results show no evidence of change in metro station single-family house price gradient induced by the introduction of bikeshare stations.**
 - I am little confused with the term "metro station house price gradient". 
 - How to distinguish this result from the second result?
