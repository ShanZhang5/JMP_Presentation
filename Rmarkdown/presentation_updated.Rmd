## Introduction

- Recycling rate <span style="color:darkgreen"> **7% &rarr; 32%**</span> from 1960s to present.

--

- For many years, most U.S. recyclables were exported to developing countries.

--

- China was the biggest importer of the U.S. recyclables.

--

- In 2017, China implemented its <span style="color:darkgreen"> **Green Sword (GS) Policy**</span> which banned almost all recyclable waste imports.

--

- Considerable domestic environmental costs: **air pollution** from re-processing of these materials, **landfill methane (GHG) emissions**, **land and water pollution**, as well as **ocean disposal**.

--

- U.S. has no **economical or efficient** recycling infrastructure.

--

- Recyclables went to landfills.

---

## Research Questions

- What is the effect of China's GS policy on <span style="color:darkgreen"> **Domestic Emissions**</span> from landfill facilities in the U.S.? 

--


- What are the key features of states that drive <span style="color:darkgreen">**Heterogeneous Changes**</span> in domestic emissions?

--


- What are the <span style="color:darkgreen">**Distributional Effects**</span> of the GS policy on pollution relocation for local communities at census block levels? 

--


- Does international trade and environmental policy affect local <span style="color:darkgreen">**Environmental Justice (EJ)**</span> problems? What's the mechanism behind?

## Roadmap
- Data
  - EPA GreenHouse Gas Report System (GHGRP)
  - CalRecycle Recycling and Disposal Reporting System (RDRS) Disposal Flow
  - U.S. Census, Trade Census, BLS, Precinct-level election data etc.

- Identification
 - Synthetic Control
 - Gravity-type fixed effects
 
- U.S. State-level Methane Emissions

- Pollution Relocation 

- Environmental Justice

- Political Costs

---

## Preliminary Findings

- U.S. State-level Methane Emissions

  - Many states have seen <span style="color:darkgreen">**statistically significant increases**</span> in methane emission caused by the GS policy.
  
  - Heterogeneous changes in domestic methane emissions relate to <span style="color:darkgreen">**historical trade volume of recyclable wastes**</span> and <span style="color:darkgreen">**stringency of environmental regulations**</span>.

--

- Pollution Relocation 
  - Before China's GS policy, waste pollution tended to relocate to <span style="color:darkgreen">**minority communities**</span>.
  
   - After the GS policy, pollution inflows increased more for <span style="color:darkgreen">**low-income White communities**</span> as a result of an increase in waste flows across regions after the exogenous GS policy shock.
   
   - Political costs is able to explain this counterintuitive finding

## Environmental Outcome Measurement

.pull-right[ 
- Why use <span style="color:darkgreen"> **methane**</span> emissions?

 - Need consistently measured emissions data from 2010 to 2020

 - They are a **proxy** for general pollution emissions:**organic hazardous air pollutants (HAP), volatile organic compounds (VOC), hydrogen sulfide**, etc. 
 
 - Methane is far more potent at trapping the sun’s heat than carbon emissions


]
---


## Data
- [U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)](https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting)

 - Methane emissions from landfill facilities 
 - 2010 to 2020 annually 

--

- Approximately 8,000 facilities required to report emissions annually

- High compliance rates

--

- Covered industries include power plants, petroleum and natural gas systems, minerals, chemicals, pulp and paper, refineries, waste, etc.

--

- Data generation process:
 - Facilities in waste industry report the **amount of wastes accepted** annually 
 - Methane Emission is calculated through a complicated model embedded in U.S. EPA

---


## Data

- [California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) Disposal Flow Data](https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/DataCentral/Materials/)

 - captures the amount of disposal transported by origin of jurisdiction and destination of facility.
 - 2002 to 2021 quarterly
 - contains 464 origin jurisdictions and 263 disposal facilities
 
--

- Other Data Sources

 - U.S. Trade Census 
 - EPA Enforcement and Compliance Historical data
 - Bureau and Labor and Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Employment and Wages at county-level
 - U.S. Census. racial composition and median income at census-block level
 - Statewide Database (SWDB) election data at precinct level
  
---

##Identification: Synthetic Control

- Relies on exogenous variation in methane emissions across <span style="color:darkgreen">**all other industries**</span> in the EPA GHGRP.

 - power plants, petroleum and natural gas systems, minerals, chemicals, pulp and paper, refineries, etc.
 
--

- Takes advantage of the fact that other industries which also emit GHG were not affected by China's GS policy.

- Uses other industries from all states to come up with a synthetic control group

--

- Train the model using pre-policy time **2010-2017**
 - calculate weights on state-industry pairs to minimize the prediction error.
$$\hat{Y_{1t}^{N}} = \sum_{j=2}^{J+1} w_{j} Y_{1t}$$


- Predict the counterfactual methane emissions using post-policy time **2018-2020** in the absence of GS policy 




---

## Results

<img src="graphs/California_synthetic_control.png" width="800" height = "350">
.center[Fig.5 **California Waste Industry Emission Synthetic Control**]

- The difference between actual emissions and synthetic emissions is the causal effect of China's GS policy on U.S. landfill methane emissions

$$\hat{\tau_{1t}} = Y_{1t} - \hat{Y_{1t}^{N}}$$

## Pollution Relocation

- How does <span style="color:darkgreen">**International Trade policy**</span> affect <span style="color:darkgreen">**pollution relocation**</span>? 

--

- Does pollution relocate? 
 - **Cap and Trade** Clean Air Act requiring new or expanding plants to pay incumbents in the same or neighboring counties to reduce their pollution emissions (Shapiro and Walker (2021)).
 
--
 
 - **US air pollution offset markets**  Clean Air Act has allowed for trading of permanent pollution emissions rights between firms within a metropolitan area (Shapiro and Walker (2020)).
 
--

 - **Externality-export strategy for air pollution**  Clean Air Act (Morehouse and Rubin (2022))

--
 
 - <span style="color:darkgreen">**Waste flow**</span> Not In my Backyard (NIMBY) regulation limits interstate waste flows (Ho (2020)).

## Preliminary Results

**California Pollution Relocation** 

- Before China's GS policy
  
  - Waste tend to relocate to <span style="color:darkgreen">**minority communities**</span>

--

- After China's GS policy
  
 - Inflows increased more for <span style="color:darkgreen">** lower-income white communities**</span>
 
--

- Counterintuitive?
    
---


## Mechanism -- Political Costs

- Racial composition of the destination community is highly correlated with political votes

.center[<img src="graphs/race_political_white_rep.png" width="400" height = "250">]

.center[Fig.13 **Correlation between White percentage by blocks and Republican votes by precinct**]

--

- Higher Republican votes, higher percentage of White population in the community

--

- Does disposal flow increase more in Republican communities due to political costs?
<br/>


---


## Theory
<font size="3"> 
- Pollution relocation depends on **transportation costs** and **political costs**
$$Y_{ij} = \frac{\overline Y_{i}}{C_{ij}(d_{ij}\cdot f_{ij})\cdot P_{ij}(V{jc})}$$
 - $Y_{ij}$ is pollution relocated from jurisdiction $i$ to facility $j$
 - $\overline Y_{i}$ is the waste pollution generated by jurisdiction $i$
 - $C_{ij}(d_{ij}\cdot f_{ij})$ is a transportation cost function w.r.t distance (overseas/domestic) and fuel price per mile
 - $P_{ij}(V{jc})$ is a political cost function w.r.t. votes in district where facility $j$ located

--

- Political costs depend on the distance between precinct(destination) votes and state-incumbent votes
$$V{jc} = v_{j} - \overline v_{c}$$
 - $v_{j}$ is the votes of the district
 - $v_{c}$ is California's incumbent votes
 - $V_{jc}$ is the political cost of the destination community

--


.pull-left[- Before China's policy shock
 - $C_{ij}(d_{ij}\cdot f_{ij})$ << $P_{ij}(V{jc})$
 - Political costs prevail
 ]

 
.pull-right[- After China's policy shock
 - $C_{ij}(d_{ij}))$ >> $P_{ij}(V{jc})$
 - Marginal political costs deminished

## Theory


.pull-center[
<img src="graphs/mechanism_1.png" width="800" height = "400">

- China's GS policy shock shifts the curve flatter (less elastic)
---


## Theory

.pull-center[

- Excessive pollution relocation shifted from "very" republican communities to "very" democratic communities
