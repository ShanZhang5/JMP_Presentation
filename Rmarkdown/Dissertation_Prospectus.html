## Background


In 2015, the U.S. exported **4.5 billion** pounds of scrap plastic for "recycling", over half of which was sold to China.

--
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
- In 2017, **China’s Green Sword (GS) Policy** bans the importation of certain types of solid waste and tightens contamination limits for some recyclable materials.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 - Policy's effect on &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;negative-externality export&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 - **Internationally**: pollution haven transition; import control; environmental justice
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 - **Domestically**: landfills and emissions; pollution relocation; environmental discrimination

## Data

- &lt;span style="color:deeppink"&gt;UN Comtrade Data&lt;/span&gt;

 - Worldwide monthly scrap import and export by types of materials and country pairs from 2002 to 2020
 
--

- &lt;span style="color:deeppink"&gt;CEPII Gravity Data&lt;/span&gt;
 - Geographical distance, trade facilitation measures, proxies for cultural proximity, macroeconomic indicators, estimated unit price of scrap material (CIF and FOB)

## The Effect of China's GS Policy on U.S. Plastic Scrap Export

**Two-way Fixed Effect Event Study**
&lt;br/&gt;
`$$y_{it} = \alpha + \sum_{d=-D, d\neq-1}^{D} 1(t-e^{i} = d) \beta_{d} + \gamma X_{it} + \theta Z_{i} + \nu T_{t} + \epsilon_{it}$$`
&lt;br/&gt;
- &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt; `\(y_{it}\)` &lt;/span&gt; is trade value of plastic scrap between the U.S. and region `\(i\)` at time `\(t\)`
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
- &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt; `\(1(t-e^{i} = d)\)` &lt;/span&gt; is an indicator variable for whether the GS policy is `\(d\)` periods away from being enacted
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
- &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt; `\(X_{it}\)` &lt;/span&gt; is a vector of socioeconomic covariates for region `\(i\)` at time `\(t\)`
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
- &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt; `\(Z_{i}\)` &lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt; `\(T_{t}\)` &lt;/span&gt; are the region and time fixed effects

## Conclusion

- GS policy diverted U.S. recyclable waste exports from China to other developing and underdeveloped countries

--

 - &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;**&amp;darr;**&lt;/span&gt; plastic wastes exports to China by 90 percent 
 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 - &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;**&amp;uarr;**&lt;/span&gt; plastic wastes exports to South/Southeast Asia and Central/South America by 150 percent and 41 percent, respectively
 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 - Individual countries in Southeast Asia have seen significant **increases** in recyclable wastes imported from the U.S. 
 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 
--

- Other developing countries implemented similar waste import control regulations **&amp;rarr;** Recyclable wastes circulating in the U.S.

]
---


## Introduction

- Recycling rate &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt; **7% &amp;rarr; 32%**&lt;/span&gt; from 1960s to present

--

- For many years, most U.S. recyclables were exported to developing countries

--

- China was the biggest importer of U.S. recyclables

--

- In 2017, China implemented its &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt; **Green Sword (GS) Policy**&lt;/span&gt; banning almost all recyclable waste imports

--

- Considerable domestic environmental costs
 - **air pollution** from re-processing of these materials
 - **landfill methane (GHG) emissions**
 - **land and water pollution**
 - **ocean disposal**

--

- U.S. has no **economical or efficient** recycling infrastructure
 - Recyclables went to landfills.

##GS Policy and Trade

&lt;img src="graphs/motivation_1.png" width="800" height = "350"&gt;
.center[Fig 3.1 Plastic Scrap Export Volume by Countries (UN Comtrade Data)]

--

- U.S. plastic scrap exports to China dropped by &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt; **99%**&lt;/span&gt;

---



##GS Policy and Trade

&lt;img src="graphs/motivation_2.png" width="800" height = "350"&gt;
.center[Fig 3.1 Plastic Scrap Export Volume by Countries (UN Comtrade Data)]

- U.S. plastic scrap exports to China dropped by &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt; **99%**&lt;/span&gt;

--

- U.S. plastic scrap exports to the ROW &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt; **increased, then  decreased** &lt;/span&gt; after China's GS policy
---

## Research Questions

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

- For the **U.S.**

 - What has been the effect of China's GS policy on &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt; **Domestic Emissions**&lt;/span&gt; from landfill facilities? 

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

--


- For the state of **California**

 - What are the &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;**Distributional Effects**&lt;/span&gt; of the GS policy on pollution relocation for local communities at census block levels? 
 - What are &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;**Environmental Justice (EJ)**&lt;/span&gt; implications?

]


.pull-right[ 
- Why use &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt; **methane**&lt;/span&gt; emissions?

 - They are a **proxy** for general pollution emissions
 
 - Methane is far more potent at trapping the sun’s heat than carbon emissions
 
 - Satellite data is available only from 2020
 
 - Need consistently measured emissions data from 2010 to 2020
]
---
   
## Data
- [U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)](https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting)

 - Methane emissions from landfill facilities 
 - 2010 to 2020 annually 

--

- Approximately 8,000 facilities required to report emissions annually

- High compliance rates

--

- Covered industries include power plants, petroleum and natural gas systems, minerals, chemicals, pulp and paper, refineries, waste, etc.

--


- Data generation process:
 - Facilities in waste industry report the **amount of wastes accepted** annually 
 - Methane Emission is calculated through a complicated model embedded in U.S. EPA

---

## Data

- [California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) Disposal Flow Data](https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/DataCentral/Materials/)

 - Captures the amount of disposal transported by origin jurisdiction and destination facility
 - 2002 to 2021 quarterly
 - Contains 464 origin jurisdictions and 263 disposal facilities
 
--

- Other Data Sources

 - U.S. Trade Census 
 - EPA Enforcement and Compliance Historical data
 - Bureau and Labor and Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Employment and Wages at county level
 - U.S. Census racial mix, median income at census-block level
  
---

##Identification: Synthetic Control Method

- Rely on exogenous variation in methane emissions across &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;**all other industries**&lt;/span&gt; in the EPA GHGRP

 - Power plants, petroleum and natural gas systems, minerals, chemicals, pulp and paper, refineries, etc. (**not** waste)
 
--

- Take advantage of the fact that other industries which also emit GHG were not affected by China's GS policy

--

- Use other industries(all states) as donor pool for synthetic control group

--

- Train the model using pre-policy time **2010-2017**
 - calculate state-industry pair weights to minimize prediction error
`$$\hat{Y_{1t}^{N}} = \sum_{j=2}^{J+1} w_{j} Y_{1t}$$`


- Predict counterfactual methane emissions in the absence of GS policy using post-policy period (**2018-2020**) 




---

## Results

&lt;img src="graphs/California_synthetic_control.png" width="800" height = "350"&gt;
.center[Fig 3.3 California Waste Industry Emission Synthetic Control]

- The difference between actual emissions and synthetic emissions is the causal effect of China's GS policy on U.S. landfill methane emissions

`$$\hat{\tau_{1t}} = Y_{1t} - \hat{Y_{1t}^{N}}$$`

## Pollution Relocation

- How does &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;**International Trade policy**&lt;/span&gt; affect &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;**pollution relocation**&lt;/span&gt;? 

--

- Does pollution relocate? 
 - **Cap and Trade** - Clean Air Act requires new or expanding plants to pay incumbents in the same or neighboring counties to reduce their pollution emissions (Shapiro and Walker (2021)).
 
--
 
 - **US air pollution offset markets** - Clean Air Act allows for trading of permanent pollution emissions rights between firms within a metropolitan area (Shapiro and Walker (2020)).
 
--

 - **Externality-export strategy for air pollution** - Clean Air Act (Morehouse and Rubin (2022))

--
 
 - &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;**Waste flow**&lt;/span&gt; - Not In my Backyard (NIMBY) regulations limit interstate waste flows (Ho (2020)).

## Mechanism -- Political Costs
- After the exogenous policy shock, marginal transportation costs relatively low 
- Total Tons of Disposal of &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;the destination facility&lt;/span&gt; by political distance from **the state average vote**
 - Political distance = county average vote - state average vote
- The most republican counties have the lowest political costs
&lt;br/&gt;

## Conclusion Preliminary Findings

- **U.S. State-level Methane Emissions**

  - Many states show &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;statistically significant increases&lt;/span&gt; in methane emission
  
  - Relate to &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;historical trade volume&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;stringency of envir. regulations&lt;/span&gt;

--

- **California Pollution Relocation** 

  - Before China's GS policy
  
   Waste tend to relocate to &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;**minority communities**&lt;/span&gt;

--

  - After China's GS policy
  
    Inflows increased more for &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;**white communities**&lt;/span&gt;
    
--
   
   - Potential mechanism 
   
   Waste relocated to places that have &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;**lower political costs**&lt;/span&gt;

**&lt;font size="5"&gt;The effect of China's Waste Import Ban on Coastal Cleanups (with Rebecca Taylor)&lt;font size="5"&gt;**
]

---

## Introduction

- China's GS Policy diverted recyclable waste exports of developed countries from China to other developing and underdeveloped countries

--

- Wastes relocation affects litter on the coast/beach

--

- Hypothesis 
 - The policy does not affect the developed (exporting) countries much because of more proper disposal, more conscious about environment, etc.
 - The policy affects the developing countries (importing) countries more because of inappropriate disposal
 
--

- Research Question
 - &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;**How does China's GS policy affect coastal cleanups across countries?**&lt;/span&gt;

---

## Next Steps
- **Two-way Fixed Effects DID Model**
`$$y_{it} = \alpha+ \beta_{1} D_{t}+ \beta_{2} T_{i} + \beta_{3}  D_{t}*T_{i} + \gamma X_{it}  + \theta Z_{i}+\nu T_{t} + \epsilon_{it}$$`
 - `\(y_{it}\)` items collected per person
 - `\(D_{t}\)` policy dummy variable
 - `\(T_{i}\)` treated countries
 - `\(Z_{i}\)` country fixed effect
 - `\(T_{t}\)` year fixed effect
 
 
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

- Expand the exporting and importing countries

- Use geographic coordinates for spatial analysis?

---

## Conclusion

- Exploit existing 2003-era online choice-experiment data
 - Re-estimate WTP function (only county-level heterogeneity)
 - Transfer fitted model to 2020--2021 pandemic context
 - WTP to avoid that many generic illnesses, deaths?

- Estimate aggregate national WTP  (Mar 2020--Dec 2021)
 - Cumulative total **~ $3 trillion** (lower bound)
 - Does not include WTP to avoid fear of contagion
 - Does not include WTP to avoid restrictions, masks
